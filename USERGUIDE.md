# User Guide

## Introduction
Visual Query Builder is a tool that allows users to build queries visually. It is designed to be used by users who are not familiar with SQL. To use the tool, users can check the tables and columns they want to query, and the tool will generate the SQL query for them. Users can also edit the query manually if they want to.

As a sql query, you will find 3 parts in the query: SELECT, WHERE and ORDER BY. The SELECT part is the columns you want to query. The WHERE part is the conditions you want to query. The ORDER BY part is the order you want to sort the result by


## Save and Load Query
After building a query in the tool, you can save the query by clicking the save button. The query will be saved in database. You can find all the queries you saved in the saved queries page, and for all the created queries, you can find them in the public queries page.

## Create user
To save a new query you must log in if you are not logged in. You can create a new user by clicking the sign up button. If you don't have and account you must create one with your name or nickname, your email and your passworkd. After creating an account you can log in with your email and password.

## In process
Is still on development the option to edit a query and the option to delete a query. Also remove an user, and comment other's queries.l
